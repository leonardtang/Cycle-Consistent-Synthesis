Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.

when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This function outputs the number of such collisions.

Otherwise, the function iterates through all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and returns the first one that divides `n` evenly.

This program checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. The program takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. The program works by iterating through the string and comparing each substring of length 2 to the substring of length n-2. If any substring of length 2 is found to be equal to the substring of length n-2, the program returns False, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If no such

##### Intended Docstring #####
We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
the following operation on the given array:
You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.

One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
then return True else return False.
If the given array is empty then return True.

Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

For Example:

move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
 be achieved for the given array.
move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
array by performing any number of right shift operations.


##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program checks if a given array has a unique element. It returns True if the array has a unique element, and False otherwise. The program first checks if the array is empty or has only one element, in which case it returns True. If the array has two elements, it checks if they are equal or not. If the array has more than two elements, it checks if the first element is greater than the second element, and then iterates over the rest of the array to check if any two consecutive elements are equal. If no two consecutive elements are equal, the program returns True.

##### Intended Docstring #####

Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
cell.
Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
necessarily distinct).
You CANNOT go off the grid.
A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

Examples:

Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 1]

Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1

A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
This program takes an integer `n` as input and returns either `x` or `y` based on whether `n` is even (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`). If `n` is even, the program returns `x`. Otherwise, it returns `y`.

I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
definitely worth noting down and comparing.
Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.


example:

compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

##### Intended Docstring #####
You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
choose the one that comes first in the list.
For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
(its strength is -1).

If the length of the two lists is not equal, the program returns False. If the two lists are equal, the program returns True. If the two lists are equal when reversed, the program returns True.

The program takes an integer input and returns a string representation of the Roman numeral corresponding to that integer. If the input is not between 1 and 1000, a ValueError is raised.

Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the highest frequency in the list. It does this by converting the list of words to a set, which removes any duplicate words, and then using the `max()` function with the `key` parameter set to the `count()` method of the `words` object to find the word with the highest frequency.

you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,

* eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
* eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
* eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]

Variables:
@number : integer
the number of carrots that you have eaten.
@need : integer
the number of carrots that you need to eat.
@remaining : integer
the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock

Constrain:
* 0 <= number <= 1000

##### Intended Docstring #####

Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

The basic algebra operations:
Addition ( + ) 
Subtraction ( - ) 
Multiplication ( * ) 
Floor division ( // ) 
Exponentiation ( ** ) 

Example:
operator['+', '*', '-']
array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
=> result = 9

Note:
The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.


##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program checks the lengths of the operator and operand lists and raises a ValueError if they are not in the expected format. If the operator list has a length of 0, 1, or more than 1, and the operand list has a length of 0, 1, or more than 1, the program returns the result of applying the operator to the first two elements of the operand list. If the operator list has a length of 0, the program raises a ValueError. If the operand list has a length of 0, the program raises a ValueError. If the operator list has a length of 1,
