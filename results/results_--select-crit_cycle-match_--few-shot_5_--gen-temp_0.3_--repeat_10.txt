Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

Note: 
1. Collatz(1) is [1].
2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

For example:
get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

##### Global Docstring Example #####

Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
cell.
Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
necessarily distinct).
You CANNOT go off the grid.
A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

Examples:

Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 1]

Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1

return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

>>> correct_bracketing("(")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("()")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
True
>>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
False

##### Global Docstring Example #####
This program checks whether a given string of brackets is balanced. It does this by iterating over each character in the string and either pushing it onto a stack if it is an opening bracket or popping it off the stack if it is a closing bracket. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, then the string is balanced and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

For example, the string "((()))" is balanced and the function would return True, while the string "))" is not balanced and the function would return False.
Correct!

##### Intended Docstring #####
Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain
duplicate values.

Examples:
can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]) = 3
can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program `can_arrange` takes a list of integers as input and returns True if the list can be arranged in such a way that the sum of all elements is 0, and False otherwise. The program first checks if the length of the list is 0 or 1, in which case it returns -1 or 0 respectively. If the length of the list is greater than 1, the program calls itself recursively with the list of integers starting from the second element.

##### Intended Docstring #####
 Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
(leftover part always smaller than 1).

Return the decimal part of the number.
>>> truncate_number(3.5)
0.5

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes an integer `number` as input and returns the difference between `number` and the largest integer less than or equal to `number` that is divisible by 2.

For example:
```
>>> number = 10
>>> return_number(number)
2
>>> number = 12
>>> return_number(number)
4
>>> number = 15
>>> return_number(number)

##### Intended Docstring #####
Given a positive integer n, return the product of the odd digits.
Return 0 if all digits are even.
For example:
digits(1)  == 1
digits(4)  == 0
digits(235) == 15

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of the digits of n raised to the power of their position in the decimal representation of n.

For example, if n is 123, the program will return 1^3 + 2^2 + 3^1 = 15.

The program works by repeatedly multiplying the last digit of n by its position in the decimal representation of n, and then dividing n by 10 to remove the last digit. This process continues until n is 0, at which point the sum of the products is returned.

In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
Otherwise, return "NO".
For example:
exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
This program checks whether two lists of the same length have the same elements. It returns "YES" if the two lists are identical and "NO" otherwise.

##### Intended Docstring #####

You are given a positive integer n. You have to create an integer array a of length n.
For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the value of a[i] = i * i - i + 1.
Return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) of a where i < j < k, 
and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.

Example :
Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 
a = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]
The only valid triple is (1, 7, 13).

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers, divided by 3.

For example:

* sum\_of\_squares(3) = 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 10 / 3 = 3.333333333333333
* sum\_of\_squares(5) = 5^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 55

##### Intended Docstring #####

Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

Note:
* don't change the given array.

Examples:
* sort_array([]) => []
* sort_array([5]) => [5]
* sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
* sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

##### Global Docstring Example #####
This program takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.

The program uses three nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of three elements from the list. For each combination, it checks if the sum of the three elements is equal to zero. If it is, the program returns True. If not, it continues to the next combination. If no combination of three elements sums to zero, the program returns False.

The program can be used to check if a given list of integers has a sum of zero that

##### Intended Docstring #####
 For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
>>> largest_divisor(15)
5

##### Global Docstring Example #####
This program takes an integer n as input and returns the smallest positive integer that divides n evenly. If no such integer exists, the function returns n itself.

For example:

* find_smallest_divisor(12) returns 4
* find_smallest_divisor(15) returns 5
* find_smallest_divisor(20) returns 20

The program uses a for loop to iterate through all positive integers from 1 to n-1. For each integer, it checks if n is divisible by that
