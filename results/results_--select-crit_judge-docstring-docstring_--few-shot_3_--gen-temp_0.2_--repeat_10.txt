##### Intended Docstring #####

Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
from two integers, round it away from zero.

Examples
>>> closest_integer("10")
10
>>> closest_integer("15.3")
15

Note:
Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a float value as input and returns its integer representation after rounding it to the nearest integer.

Example:

* For value = 3.5, the output will be 3.
* For value = 2.3, the output will be 2.
* For value = 4.2, the output will be 4.

Constraints:

* The input value must be a float.
* The output value will always be an integer.

The program takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its factors.

If `n` is less than 2, the program returns an empty list.

The program iterates over all numbers from 2 to `n + 1` and checks if `n` is divisible by that number. If it is, the number is added to the `factors` list and `n` is divided by that number.

The program continues this process until `n` is less than 2, at which point the program returns the `factors` list.

Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This function outputs the number of such collisions.

##### Intended Docstring #####
Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
tri(1) = 3
tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
For example:
tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
tri(4) = 3
tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
   = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

##### Intended Docstring #####

You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
some order, that the resulting string will be good.
A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
'())' is not.
Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

Examples:
match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program is a stack-based implementation of a simple expression parser that checks if a given expression is balanced. The input is a list of characters representing an arithmetic expression, and the output is a string indicating whether the expression is balanced or not. The program uses a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses in the expression. If the input character is an opening parenthesis, it is pushed onto the stack. If the input character is a closing parenthesis, it is popped from the stack. If the stack is empty when a closing parenthesis is encountered, the expression is not balanced and the program returns "No".

Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
cell.
Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
necessarily distinct).
You CANNOT go off the grid.
A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

Examples:

Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3

previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

The program takes a positive integer N as input and returns the total sum of its digits in binary.

The program first initializes an empty string called binary. It then enters a while loop that continues until the decimal value is greater than 0.

Inside the loop, the program converts the decimal value to binary using the modulo operator (%), which returns the remainder of the division of the decimal value by 2. The binary value is then concatenated to the beginning of the binary string using the concatenation operator (+).

After the while loop, the program returns the binary string.

 brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program is a stack-based implementation of a simple expression parser that checks for matching pairs of brackets "<" and ">". It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and pops them off the stack when it encounters a closing bracket of the same type. If the stack is empty or the top element on the stack does not match the current bracket, the program appends the bracket to the stack. The program returns True if the stack is empty after processing all the brackets, indicating that the brackets were properly matched.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
Given a list of integers and a delimiter, return a string representation of the list with the delimiter at the beginning and end of the string.

Example:

* Input: lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and delimiter = ","
* Output: ",1,2,3,4,5,"

 From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
in the sequence.
>>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a list of numbers and returns a list containing the maximum value in the list and all the values that are equal to the maximum value. If the input list is empty, the program returns an empty list. The program initializes the maximum value to the first element of the list and the list of maximum values to a list containing only the maximum value. Then, it iterates over the rest of the elements in the list and updates the maximum value if a larger value is found. Finally, the program appends the maximum value to the list of maximum values.

##### Intended Docstring #####

Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower 
case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.
The function should return False is the given dictionary is empty.
Examples:
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "b":"banana"}) should return True.
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "A":"banana", "B":"banana"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", 8:"banana", "a":"apple"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" }) should return True.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a dictionary as input and returns True if all keys in the dictionary are strings and all values are lowercase. If any key is not a string or any value is not lowercase, the program returns False.

Example:
```
dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 'c', 'd': 2}
print(check_dict(dict)) # True

dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 'c', 'd': 2, 'e': 'F'}
print(check_dict(dict)) # False

You are given a list of integers.
Write a function next_smallest() that returns the 2nd smallest element of the list.
Return None if there is no such element.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a list of strings and returns the list that has the total number of characters in all strings less than the other list. If the two lists have the same number of characters, it returns the first list.

Example:

* total\_match([], []) ➞ []
* total\_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
* total\_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']) ➞ ['hi', 'admin']

##### Intended Docstring #####
You are given two intervals,
where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
includes both start and end.
For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
intervals is a prime number.
Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
otherwise, return "NO".
If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".


[input/output] samples:
intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes in two intervals represented as tuples of two integers, and returns "YES" if the intervals overlap, and "NO" otherwise.

Example:

* If interval1 = (1, 5) and interval2 = (2, 7), the program returns "YES" because the intervals overlap.
* If interval1 = (1, 5) and interval2 = (6, 10), the program returns "NO" because the intervals do not overlap.

Constraints:

* The intervals are represented as tuples of two integers, where the
