##### Intended Docstring #####
Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
Examples:
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]

This program takes a string `s` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of words from `s` that have a length of `n`. The words are split from the string using the `split()` method, and then filtered using a list comprehension to only include words with the desired length.

Example:
```
s = "This is an example sentence with three words."
n = 3
result = [word for word in s.split() if len(word) == n]
print(result)  # Output: ['is', 'an', 'example']

You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.

Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
tri(1) = 3
tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
For example:
tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
tri(4) = 3
tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
   = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

the following operation on the given array:
You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.

One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
then return True else return False.

This program takes a string `paren_string` and returns a list of the lengths of the groups of parentheses in the string. It does this by using regular expressions to find all the groups of parentheses in the string, and then counting the number of parentheses in each group using a list comprehension. The resulting list contains the lengths of the groups of parentheses.

##### Intended Docstring #####

You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
some order, that the resulting string will be good.
A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
'())' is not.
Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

Examples:
match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'

Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
cell.
Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
necessarily distinct).
You CANNOT go off the grid.
A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

Examples:

Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 1]

Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1

previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
Examples:
For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
