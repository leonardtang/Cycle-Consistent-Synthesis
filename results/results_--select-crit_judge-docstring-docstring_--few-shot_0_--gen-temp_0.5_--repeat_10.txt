Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This function outputs the number of such collisions.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
This program calculates the number of collisions between two objects in a given range of positions. It does this by iterating through all pairs of objects in the range and checking if their positions differ by only 1.

##### Intended Docstring #####
We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
the following operation on the given array:
You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.

One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
then return True else return False.
If the given array is empty then return True.

Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

For Example:

move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
 be achieved for the given array.
move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
array by performing any number of right shift operations.

from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
cell.
Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
necessarily distinct).
You CANNOT go off the grid.
A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

Examples:

Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 1]

Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1

Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
tri(1) = 3
tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
For example:
tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
tri(4) = 3
tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
   = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the

Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.


example:

compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program "pass" is a simple script that serves as a placeholder or a "no-op" operation in Python. It does not perform any actual task or operation, but it can be used as a placeholder in certain situations, such as when a function or block of code is required but no action needs to be taken. The program is intended to be a harmless and inconsequential operation that does not affect the program's overall behavior or output.

##### Intended Docstring #####
You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
choose the one that comes first in the list.
For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
(its strength is -1).
Example:
for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes an integer `number` as input and returns a string representation of the Roman numeral equivalent of the input number. The program checks if the input number is between 1 and 1000, and if it is, it iterates through a list of Roman numeral characters and appends them to a string `result`. If the input number is not between 1 and 1000, the program raises a `ValueError`.
