!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 1 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####

"Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

Example 1:
Input: [4,2,3]
Output: [2, 1]
Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [2, 1]
Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

Example 3:
Input: []
Output: []

Example 4:
Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
 so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

Constraints:
* 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
* 0 <= node.value

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined

previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

For example:

after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

Examples:

Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 1]

Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1

You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
Examples:
For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
For num = "2020" the output should be 2.

Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

This function outputs the number of such collisions.

I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
definitely worth noting down and comparing.
Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.


example:

compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]

The program `digits_sum` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the absolute values of the digits of `n`. If `n` is negative, the first signed digit will be negative.

The program `count_nums` takes an array of integers and returns the number of elements which has a sum of digits greater than 0. If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative.

The program `correct_bracketing` takes a string of "<" and ">" as input and returns True if every opening bracket has a

count\_nums(arr):

* count\_nums takes an array of integers and returns the number of elements that have a sum of digits greater than 0.
* If a number is negative, its first signed digit will be negative.
* The function returns the number of elements that meet this criteria.

of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.

Write a function `count_nums` which takes an array of integers and returns the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0. If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative: e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.

* The function takes an array of integers as input.
* It returns the number of elements in the array whose sum of digits is greater than 0.
* If a number is negative, its first signed digit will be negative.

##### Intended Docstring #####

Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower 
case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.
The function should return False is the given dictionary is empty.
Examples:
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "b":"banana"}) should return True.
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", "A":"banana", "B":"banana"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"a":"apple", 8:"banana", "a":"apple"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"Name":"John", "Age":"36", "City":"Houston"}) should return False.
check_dict_case({"STATE":"NC", "ZIP":"12345" }) should return True.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
Documentation:

* The program takes a dictionary as input and returns True if all keys in the dictionary are strings, otherwise False.
* If the dictionary is empty, the function returns False.
* The function iterates through the keys of the dictionary and checks if the type of each key is a string.
* If any key is not a string, the function returns False immediately.
* If all keys are strings, the function returns True.

>>> dict = {'a': 1, 'b': '2', 'c': 3}
