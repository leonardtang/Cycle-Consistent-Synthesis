are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
'())' is not.
Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

##### Intended Docstring #####
We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
the following operation on the given array:
You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.

One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
then return True else return False.
If the given array is empty then return True.

Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

For Example:

move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True

Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
cell.
Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
necessarily distinct).
You CANNOT go off the grid.
A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

Examples:

Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

##### Intended Docstring #####
You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
choose the one that comes first in the list.
For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
(its strength is -1).
Example:
for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'

between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
Otherwise, return "NO".
For example:

##### Global Docstring Example #####
Given a number `number` and an integer `need`, return a list containing either the difference between `number` and `need`, or the difference between `need` and `number`, depending on which is greater. If `number` is greater than or equal to `need`, return the first difference. Otherwise, return the second difference.

Example:
```
>>> diff_list(5, 2)
[3, 3]
>>> diff_list(5, 3)
[2, 2]
>>> diff_list(5, 1)
[4, 



!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 150 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
You are given a string s.
Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.
A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct
For example:
is_happy(a) => False
is_happy(aa) => False
is_happy(abcd) => True
is_happy(aabb) => False
is_happy(adb) => True
is_happy(xyy) => False

##### Global Docstring Example #####
This program checks whether a given string s has a length of less than 3 characters. If it does, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

Example:
```
>>> s = "hello"
>>> if len(s) < 3:
...     return False
... else:
...     return True
...
True
```

This program takes a string s as input and returns True if its length is less than 3 characters, and False otherwise.

The program `return string.swapcase()` takes a string as input and returns a new string with all lowercase characters flipped to uppercase and vice versa.

The program `return n%2 == 0 and n >= 8` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, and `False` otherwise.

The program `return [(e + 1) for e in l]` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list with each element incremented by

##### Intended Docstring #####
 Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
>>> factorize(8)
[2, 2, 2]
>>> factorize(25)
[5, 5]
>>> factorize(70)
[2, 5, 7]

##### Global Docstring Example #####
Return a list of factors of a given number n.
>>> factors(12)
[2, 2, 3]
>>> factors(15)
[3, 5]
>>> factors(20)
[2, 2, 2, 5]



!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 153 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
Given a positive integer n, return the product of the odd digits.
Return 0 if all digits are even.
For example:
digits(1)  == 1
digits(4)  == 0
digits(235) == 15

##### Global Docstring Example #####
Return the value of n multiplied by the sum of the digits of n-1.

Example:

* digits(5) = 5
* digits(4) = 4
* digits(3) = 3
* digits(2) = 2
* digits(1) = 1

Therefore, digits(5) + digits(4) + digits(3) + digits(2) + digits(1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15

!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 158 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
Task
We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
then check if the result string is palindrome.
A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
Example
For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a string s and a character c as input and returns a string that contains all the characters in s except for the character c. If the resulting string is the same as its reverse, the function returns the string and True, otherwise it returns the string and False.

Example:
```
result = ''
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == c:
        continue
    else:
        result += s[i]
if result == result[::-1]:
    return result,True
else:
    return result,False
