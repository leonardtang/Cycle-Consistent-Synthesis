!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 0 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
given threshold.
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
False
>>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
True




!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 1 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
Ignore any spaces in the input string.
>>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
['()', '(())', '(()())']




!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
(leftover part always smaller than 1).

Return the decimal part of the number.
>>> truncate_number(3.5)
0.5




!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fallls below zero, and
at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
False
>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
True




!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 4 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
around the mean of this dataset.
Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
MAD = average | x - x_mean |
>>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0




!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 5 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
>>> intersperse([], 4)
[]
>>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]




!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 6 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

>>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
[2, 3, 1, 3]




!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 7 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring
>>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')
[]
>>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
['abc', 'bacd', 'array']

Correct!



!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 8 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
>>> sum_product([])
(0, 1)
>>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
(10, 24)

Correct!



!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 9 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
in the sequence.
>>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]




!!!!!!!!!!!!! Evaluating Question 10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
##### Intended Docstring #####
 Test if given string is a palindrome
