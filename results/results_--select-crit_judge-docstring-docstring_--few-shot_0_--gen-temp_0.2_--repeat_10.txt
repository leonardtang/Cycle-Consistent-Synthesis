If none of the prime factors of `n` are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function iterates through all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and returns the first one that divides `n` evenly.

This program checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. The program takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. The program works by iterating through the string and comparing each substring of length 2 to the substring of length n-2. If any substring of length 2 is found to be equal to the substring of length n-2, the program returns False, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If no such

##### Intended Docstring #####
We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
the following operation on the given array:
You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.

One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
then return True else return False.
If the given array is empty then return True.

Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

For Example:

move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
 be achieved for the given array.
move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
array by performing any number of right shift operations.

##### Intended Docstring #####

Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
cell.
Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
necessarily distinct).
You CANNOT go off the grid.
A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

Examples:

Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 1]

Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1

Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.

double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
If the input list is empty, return 0.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program calculates the sum of the squares of all odd integers in a list. It iterates through each number in the list, checks if it is an integer and less than 0, and skips it if it is. If the number is odd, it is squared and added to the sum of squares. Finally, the sum of squares is returned.

I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
definitely worth noting down and comparing.
Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.


example:

compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
choose the one that comes first in the list.
For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
(its strength is -1).

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with all alphabetic characters converted to uppercase and all non-alphabetic characters converted to lowercase. The program uses the `map()` function to apply a lambda function to each character in the input string. The lambda function checks if the character is alphabetic and returns either its uppercase or lowercase version, depending on whether it is uppercase or lowercase, respectively. The `join()` function is then used to concatenate the results of the `map()` function into a single string.
