The program is a simple algorithm that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the smallest integer `i` that divides `n` evenly, or `n` itself if no such integer exists. The algorithm works by iterating over all integers `i` from 2 to `n-1`, checking if `n` is divisible by `i`, and returning `i` if it is. If no such integer is found, the algorithm returns `n`.

##### Intended Docstring #####
We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
the following operation on the given array:
You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.

One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
then return True else return False.
If the given array is empty then return True.

Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

For Example:

move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
 be achieved for the given array.
move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
array by performing any number of right shift operations.

The program takes an array of integers as input and returns an integer as output. If the input array is empty, the program returns None. Otherwise, the program calculates the result by first summing the absolute values of all elements in the array using the built-in `sum()` function and the `map()` function with the `abs()` function as the argument. Then, the program multiplies the sum by the product of the elements in the array, where positive elements are multiplied by 1 and negative elements are multiplied by -1, using the built-in `prod()` function and the `

##### Intended Docstring #####

Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
cell.
Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
necessarily distinct).
You CANNOT go off the grid.
A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

Examples:

Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 1]

Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
Output: [1]

The program takes in a grid and a value "k" as input and returns a list of elements from the grid based on the value of "k". If the grid is empty or "k" is not provided, the program returns an empty list. If the grid has only one element, the program returns that element. If the grid has two elements, the program compares the first element with "k" and returns the first element if it is less than "k", otherwise it returns the second element. If the grid has three elements, the program compares the first element with "k", then compares the second element with

Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
tri(1) = 3
tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
For example:
tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
tri(4) = 3
tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
   = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8

##### Intended Docstring #####

Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.

double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
If the input list is empty, return 0.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program calculates the sum of the squares of all odd numbers in a list. It does this by iterating through the list, checking if each number is odd (i.e., has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2), and then squaring the number and adding it to a running total. The final result is returned as the sum of all the squares of odd numbers in the list.

I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
definitely worth noting down and comparing.
Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.


example:

compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program checks if the length of the game and guess arrays are equal. If they are not equal, it prints an error message and returns. If the game array is empty, it also prints an error message and returns.

##### Intended Docstring #####
You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
choose the one that comes first in the list.
For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
(its strength is -1).
Example:
for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'

##### Global Docstring Example #####
This program calculates the strength of a given string of extensions, which are a sequence of letters. It does this by iterating through each extension and calculating its strength based on the number of uppercase letters it contains. The program keeps track of the extension with the highest strength and returns the class name followed by that extension.

Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

The basic algebra operations:
Addition ( + ) 
Subtraction ( - ) 
Multiplication ( * ) 
Floor division ( // ) 
Exponentiation ( ** ) 

Example:
operator['+', '*', '-']
array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
=> result = 9

Note:
The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.


##### Global Docstring Example #####
This program is a function that takes in an operator and a list of operands, and returns the result of applying the operator to the operands.
