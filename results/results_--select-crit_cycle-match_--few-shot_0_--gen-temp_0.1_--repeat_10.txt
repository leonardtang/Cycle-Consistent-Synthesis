In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.

It must be implemented like this:
>>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]
>>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array of integers sorted in ascending order based on the number of binary digits in each integer. The sorting is done using the built-in Python `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the key argument. The lambda function converts each integer to its binary representation using the built-in Python `bin()` function and then counts the number of occurrences of the digit "1" in the binary representation using the `count()` method. The resulting array is sorted in ascending order based on the count of the digit "1

##### Intended Docstring #####

Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

Note: 
1. Collatz(1) is [1].
2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

For example:
get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers representing the sequence of numbers obtained by applying the Collatz sequence algorithm to `n`. The Collatz sequence algorithm is a recursive function that generates a sequence of numbers by repeatedly applying the following rule: if the number is even, divide it by 2; otherwise, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The program returns the sequence of numbers obtained by applying the Collatz sequence algorithm to `n`, starting with `n` as the first element in the sequence.

Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
cell.
Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
necessarily distinct).
You CANNOT go off the grid.
A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

Examples:

Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 1]

Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1

##### Intended Docstring #####

Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
order them based on their index in original list.

For example:
>>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
>>> order_by_points([]) == []

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a list of numbers as input and returns a sorted list of numbers based on the sum of their digits. The sum of digits is calculated using the built-in `sum()` function and the `map()` function to convert each number to a string and then to an integer. The `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function is set to a lambda function that calculates the sum of digits for each number in the list. The resulting list is then sorted in ascending order based on the sum of digits.

Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
For example:
specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the length of the filtered list. The filtering criteria are as follows:

* Only integers greater than 10 are included in the filtered list.
* Only odd integers are included in the filtered list.
* Only integers that are either 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 modulo 10 are included in the filtered list.

The resulting filtered list is then returned as the length of the list.

##### Intended Docstring #####
Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,
deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,
and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,
The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,
and it may contain duplicates.
The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you
should return the list sorted by that rule.
If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.
The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.
You may assume that all words will have the same length.
For example:
assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a list of items as input and returns a new list of items sorted in ascending order based on the length of each item. The key function used in the sorted() function is len, which returns the length of each item in the list. The resulting list will have the shortest items at the beginning and the longest items at the end.

I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
definitely worth noting down and comparing.
Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.


example:

compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
choose the one that comes first in the list.
For example, if you are given "Slices" as the class and a list of the
extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should
return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension 
(its strength is -1).
Example:
for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'

Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

The basic algebra operations:
Addition ( + ) 
Subtraction ( - ) 
Multiplication ( * ) 
Floor division ( // ) 
Exponentiation ( ** ) 

Example:
operator['+', '*', '-']
array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
=> result = 9

Note:
The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.


##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations based on the length of the input operator string. If the length of the operator is 0, the program returns the operand. If the length of the operator is 1, the program multiplies the operand by the first character of the operator. If the length of the operator is 2, the program multiplies the operand by the first character of the operator and adds the operand multiplied by the second character of the operator. If the length of the operator is 3, the program multiplies the operand by the first character of the operator, adds the operand

solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"

##### Global Docstring Example #####
The program takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with all lowercase letters converted to lowercase and all uppercase letters converted to uppercase. The program uses the `map()` function to iterate over each character in the string and applies a lambda function to each character. The lambda function checks if the character is an alphabetic character and returns either its lowercase or uppercase version, depending on whether it is already lowercase or uppercase. The `join()` function is then used to combine the resulting list of characters into a single string.
